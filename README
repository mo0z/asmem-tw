Description:
============

This is an AfterStep look & feel memory utilization monitor
for X Windows.

I used this asmem tool written by alinden@netcologne.de
for quite a while. It served the purpose but I was very
unsatisfied with its appearance. I wanted something that
would fit nicely between all other applets on my desktop.
I tried to contact the author a few times but got no answer.
So I decided to rewrite it from scratch and give it the look 
and options that I personally like. I hope the author of 
the original asmem will not be too angry with me.

The display consists of two areas. The one above shows utilization
of the memory, the one below - the utilization of the swap
space. Each area contains a graphical bar that represents the
percentage of the available space. For the memory utilization
there are three bars: user/system memory used, buffer memory
and cache memory. For the swap space only one bar showing the
used space. Above each bar is the total amount of space, below
the bar - the available space in kbytes and percents. If the
memory amount is above 999999 kbytes the displays switches
to Mbytes instead of kbytes.

The program may be used directly or in the Afterstep "wharf". It also 
supports the WindowMaker docker (-withdrawn option). It may be used 
in all other window managers as well. It runs well as an icon.

You may want to have a look in the CHANGES file for the history of updates.
