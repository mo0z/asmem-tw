asmem-tw is a small GUI memory usage tracking in Xlib.

I had been using the "asmem" utility from Albert "Tigr" Dorofeev
<albert@tigr.net> for decades. One day I was using a machine with lots of
memory and noticed the asmem utility wasn't working correctly. I looked into
the sources and updated to get it to work. I personally was only using it on
Linux machines so while updating the code I also removed any that wasn't
useful for me.

I started with the sources for asmem-1.10, so it is safe to say this project
is based on the other one. But how much of the original remains in the final
is to be seen. "Not much" is what I'd guess.

I emailed Albert with my updates, but he didn't seem too interested (which is
understandable). So I hope he doesn't mind me making this forked project
publicly available.
