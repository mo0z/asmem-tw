18 Sep 2003	1.10	albert@tigr.net

		Patch from Phil DeBecker <debecker@ntplx.net>:
		 Asmem doesn't work on Linux 2.6 because the format 
		 of /proc/meminfo changed -- basically the nice summary 
		 lines at the head of the output are gone, so you only 
		 have the individual fields.  The little patch I've 
		 written modifies read_mem.c so that it looks for each of
		 these individual fields in order to populate the memory 
		 stats.  This works on 2.4 kernels as well, since it 
		 doesn't rely on the length or specific position of each 
		 of the labels, only on the order in which they appear.

21 Oct 2001	1.9	albert@tigr.net

		Patch from Alexander Kotelnikov <sacha@debian.org>
		that makes sure asmem compiles on Hurd.

20 Jul 2000	1.8	albert@tigr.net

		Another patch by Andre Yelistratov <andre@express.ru>:
		"Well, it seems to be a problem with CPU load in newly 
		implemented system call in FreeBSD 4.0, therefore I have 
		attached asmem.diff, containing patch for this problem..."

16 Jun	2000	1.7	albert@tigr.net

		Andre Yelistratov <andre@express.ru> ported asmem
		to FreeBSD. This port should work fine with most
		FreeBSD flavours. Verified on 2.2.4, 3.4, 4.0.

09 Feb 2000	1.6	albert@tigr.net

		Scott  Bamford <sab@zeekuschrist.com> has created
		a patch for NetBSD:

		"Heres a patch i made to it to alow it to work on NetBSD. 
		As far as i know it should be compatible with any which 
		use UVM (does OpenBSD?)."

		This addition to the asmem code is distributed
		under BSD style license.

16 Dec 1999	1.5	albert@tigr.net

		Changed the internal loop to react to the absolute
		value of the difference in time for the update.
		Suggested by Nicola Bernardini <nicb@axnet.it>

		Yes, it is still me. I just found that some
		people may not have swap space (however weird
		this sounds) so I fixed a potential bug with
		division by zero.

23 Jul 1999	1.3	albert@mail.dma.be

		Suddenly I decided that I do not want to see
		the amount of memory available but the amount
		of memory consumed. Voila. There it is - a yet
		another switch.

		Anders Rundegren <anders@rundegren.com> writes:
		"Wouldn't it be nice if there was a switch to make asmem 
		display memory usage in MegaBytes instead of kiloBytes... 
		it gets pretty cluttered when  all those numbers are 
		shown in that little window!?"
		Ok, done :) the -mb switch.

08 Mar 1999	1.1	albert@mail.dma.be

		Added the '-free' switch to be able
		to see the values returned by the /proc/meminfo
		for the free memory instead of the values
		calculated by the applet.

		Changed the /proc/meminfo reading routines
		and the screen updating in an attempt to minimize
		CPU consumption. Mmmmm... it kinda worked out :)
		You can say asmem is optimized a bit now.

02 Mar 1999	1.0	albert@mail.dma.be

		Completely rewritten from scratch.
		The new version is not based on the code
		from 0.1, only the idea is the same.

20 Oct 1998	albert@mail.dma.be asmem-0.1-1

		Added options -noborder and -v and created
		a manpage.
